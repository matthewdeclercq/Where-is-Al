        <p>Made it to Neels Gap after a week on trail that felt like a month in dog years. Mountain Crossings is basically hiker Mecca - I scored some socks that look like they were designed by NASA and ditched 5 pounds of gear I swore I needed (turns out my emergency harmonica wasn't essential). Blood Mountain's climb was so brutal I considered becoming a beach bum instead. But that sunrise from the top? Worth every bead of sweat that's now fossilizing on my shirt!</p>
