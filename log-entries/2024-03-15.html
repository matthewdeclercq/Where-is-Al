        <p>Started the AT today! Springer Mountain was foggier than a hipster coffee shop and colder than my ex's heart. Met several other NOBO hikers at the summit who all looked suspiciously well-rested. The first few miles were tougher than explaining crypto to your grandma - my pack weighs more than my emotional baggage and I'm already googling "nearest airport." But damn, those views could make a monk renounce his vows!</p>
