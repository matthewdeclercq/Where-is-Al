        <p>Crossed into North Carolina and hit Fontana Dam today. The Smokies loom ahead like nature's version of those optical illusion posters - equal parts majestic and "please don't hurt me." Weather forecast is calling for rain that'll make Noah look like an amateur. But hey, my rain gear is dialed tighter than a submarine hatch and my trail family is more solid than my dad jokes. Time to embrace the suck!</p>
