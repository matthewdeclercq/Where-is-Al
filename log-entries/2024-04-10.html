        <p>What a day that could only happen on the AT! Hitched into Hot Springs with a guy whose truck smelled like freedom and wet socks. Soaked in natural hot springs that felt like winning the lottery while staring at the French Broad River. Then some trail angels who looked like they escaped a Hallmark movie fed us burgers thicker than my trail journal and fresh fruit that didn't come from a can. The kindness of strangers on this trail makes me want to start a cult!</p>
